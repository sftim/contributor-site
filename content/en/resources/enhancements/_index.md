A Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) is a way to propose, communicate and coordinate on new efforts for the Kubernetes project. You can read more details about the process in [KEP 1](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/0001-kubernetes-enhancement-proposal-process.md).

This process is in a beta state and is mandatory for all enhancements from release 1.14 of Kubernetes.
